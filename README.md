Portal-Swarm is Portal 2007's code and HL2 2013's code ported to Alien Swarm.

There are no extra fixes made, the fixes that are made are to make something functional during the porting process.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem possible to mount the Portal VPKs or HL2 VPKs directly. SFM is needed for the hl2 content, but for Portal you'll need to dump everything from portal_pak_dir.vpk to the pak01_dir folder, you won't need to turn this into a VPK, but do not replace the Chell models as those are recompiled for Swarm compatibility.
